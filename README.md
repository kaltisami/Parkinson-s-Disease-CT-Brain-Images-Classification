Introduction
------------

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management. This project focuses on analyzing CT brain images to identify patterns indicative of Parkinson's disease.

Data Preprocessing
------------------

In this section, we will cover the steps taken to clean and prepare the CT images for analysis, including:

-   Image resizing
-   Normalization
-   Data augmentation techniques

Model Training
--------------

We implement various machine learning algorithms, including:

-   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
-   Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

The notebook provides code snippets for training these models on the preprocessed data.

Evaluation Metrics
------------------

Model performance is assessed using:

-   Accuracy
-   Precision
-   Recall
-   F1-score

Graphs and tables are included to illustrate model performance.

Visualization
-------------

Tools for visualizing predictions and performance metrics are provided, enabling a clearer understanding of model effectiveness.
