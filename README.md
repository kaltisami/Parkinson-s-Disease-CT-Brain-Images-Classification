# Parkinsonâ€™s Disease CT Brain Images Classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of brain images from CT scans of patients with Parkinson's disease. The goal is to assist in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease through automated image analysis.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing CT images for analysis.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to classify images.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessment of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Tools to visualize model predictions and performance metrics.
