\## Introduction

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management. This project focuses on analyzing CT brain images to identify patterns indicative of Parkinson's disease.

\## Data Preprocessing

In this section, we will cover the steps taken to clean and prepare the CT images for analysis, including:

\- Image resizing

\- Normalization

\- Data augmentation techniques

\## Model Training

We implement various machine learning algorithms, including:

\- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

\- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

The notebook provides code snippets for training these models on the preprocessed data.

\## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is assessed using:

\- Accuracy

\- Precision

\- Recall

\- F1-score

Graphs and tables are included to illustrate model performance.

\## Visualization

Tools for visualizing predictions and performance metrics are provided, enabling a clearer understanding of model effectiveness.
